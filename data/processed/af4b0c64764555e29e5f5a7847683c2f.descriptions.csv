Eleocharis palustris," A  glabrous, loosely to rather densely tufted perennial 10-60(-95)  cm. Rhizomethick, far-creeping, producing single stems in the first season, then many small tufts. Stems stout or slender (1-4 mm diam), reddish at base; sheaths all lfless, to 25 cm, yellowish-brown, the upper ±          transversely truncate.  Infl an oblong to lanceolate-ovoid, terminal spikelet, 5-20(-30) mm, many fld.  Glumes ovate, brown, midrib green, margins hyaline, closely imbricate; two lowest glumes sterlie, much shorter than spikelet, not more than 1/2 encircling base of spikelet. Bristles 0-4, shorter or longer than fruit, sometimes 0. Stamens 3; anthers 1.6-2.5 mm. Stigmas 2.  Nut(1.2-)1.5-2.0 x 1.3-1.5 mm biconvex, finely punctate or nearly smooth, yellow to deep brown, swollen style base constricted at base.  ssp vulgaris Walters: Spikelets  usually with <40 flrs; glumes from middle of spikelet 3.75-4.5 mm, variable in colour but usually� dark brown           ; nut (1.3)1.5-2 mm.  ssp palustris: spikelets more densely fld, usually with >40 flrs; glumes from middle of spikelet 2.7-3.5 mm, rather pale, often light brown, usually more easily detached than in ssp vulgaris; nut 1.2-1.4(1.5) mm.  Partial fertile hybrids between ssp found in Oxon. "
Eleocharis palustris,"Common spike-rush, marsh spike-rush, éléocharide des marais  



Plants perennial, mat-forming; rhizomes evident, long, 1.5–4.5 mm thick, firm to hard (or soft), cortex persistent, longer internodes 10–35 mm, scales usually persistent, 6–20 mm, membranous, sometimes slightly fibrous.  Culms terete or slightly compressed, often with 8–30 blunt ridges when dry, 30–115 cm × 0.5–5 mm, firm to soft, internally spongy.  Leaves: distal leaf sheaths persistent or sometimes disintegrating, often splitting adaxially, red or blackish proximally, green or red distally, not inflated, not callose, membranous to papery, apex broadly obtuse to acute, tooth absent.  Spikelets ovoid to lanceoloid, 5–25 × 3–7 mm, apex acute to obtuse; proximal scale clasping 2/3 or sometimes 3/4 of culm, entire; subproximal scales 1–2, empty; floral scales often spreading in fruit, 30–100, 4–8 per mm of rachilla, brown, midrib regions mostly stramineous to green, ovate to lanceolate, 3–5 × 1.5–2.5 mm, apex entire, acute or subacute, often carinate in distal part of spikelet.  Flowers: perianth bristles 4(–5), sometimes absent, medium brown to stramineous, slender to stout, much shorter than achene to equaling tubercle, rarely to 2 times as long as achene; stamens 3; anthers dark yellow to stramineous, 1.5–2.2 mm; styles 2-fid, very rarely some 3-fid.  Achenes not persistent, stramineous or dark brown, biconvex, angles obscure, obovoid to obpyriform, 1.1–2 × 1–1.5 mm, apex rounded, neck absent or mostly short (to long), smooth at 30X, sometimes finely rugulose at 10–20X and with 20 or more ridges in vertical series.  Tubercles brown to whitish, pyramidal to mamillate, as high as wide to 2 times higher, 0.3–0.7 × 0.35–0.7 mm.  2n = 16, 17, 36.

Variant a (Eleocharis smallii in the strict sense) has culms mostly 1–3 mm wide; distal leaf sheaths sometimes disintegrating, often splitting adaxially, summits often with red margins, apices obtuse to broadly acute; floral scales 3–4 mm; achenes to 1.5(–1.6) mm; culm stomates 39–48 µm (based on very few measurements).  Reported chromosome numbers for which I have seen vouchers, all from Kansas, are 2n = 16, 17 (L. J. Harms 1968).  The range of variant a is mostly northeastern, where it is known from elevations to 1700 m in Newfoundland, west to Manitoba and south to North Carolina, Kentucky, Missouri, and Kansas, with one collection from east-central Alaska.


Variant b is similar to variant a and intergrades with it.   It has culms only 0.5–1.2 mm wide; distal leaf sheaths persistent and not splitting, summits usually with markedly red margins, markedly oblique when viewed from the side, apices acute to narrowly obtuse; and spikelets with proximal scale often clasping 3/4 of the culm.  At least some of these slender plants may simply be meadow or grassland forms produced by the direct effects of unfavorable enviromental factors such as competition.  Variant b is mostly sympatric with variant a; it is more common in the Southeast, where it is known south to Louisiana and Arkansas.  Plants from the more southern part of the range are especially striking because of their extremely oblique, brightly red-margined sheath summits and proximal floral scales usually clasping to 3/4 of the culm.


Variant c may be called Eleocharis palustris var. vigens L. H. Bailey.  The lectotype is from the shores of Lake Champlain in Vermont (S. G. Smith 2001).  It is similar to unusually robust forms of variant a, from which it differs in that its achenes are 1.6–2 mm, culm stomates 52–65 µm, and floral scales mostly 3.5–4.5 mm.  Because of its large achenes and stomates, variant c is assumed to be tetraploid with 2n = 36 (S.-O. Strandhede 1967; L. J. Harms 1968).  Variant c apparently grows mostly as an emergent in open water to about 1 m deep.  Its known range is northeastern, from Newfoundland and Labrador to Manitoba, south to New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nebraska.


Variant d comprises most of the plants that cannot be placed in the preceding variants.  Most of these plants closely resemble most specimens that I have seen from northern Eurasia and as described for Eleocharis palustris subsp. palustris by S.-O. Strandhede (1966).  Variant d has distal leaf sheaths often splitting or disintegrating, the summit margins not reddish, and apices usually broadly obtuse.  In North America variant d is mostly subarctic and boreal; it is known from Newfoundland and Labrador to Alaska, south to New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, New Mexico, and California.  Some plants of variant d that have markedly narrow tubercles mostly much (to 2 times) higher than wide and narrow achenes only 0.9–1.1 mm wide may deserve taxonomic recognition; they are known from Manitoba west to British Columbia and Alaska, south to Colorado, Utah, and California.  Specimens of variant d from scattered western localities from Alaska and Yukon south to California have floral scales 4–5 mm and achenes 1.6–1.9 mm and are very similar to variant c."

This is a widespread, semi-aquatic weed of N temperate regions of the world, now introduced to Australia and elsewhere.

East Asian forms tend to have more obvious awns than usual, perhaps due to introgression from Alopecurus longearistatus. Alopecurus amurensis and A. aristulatus are both based on such forms. A form from South America with glabrous glumes has been separated as A. hitchcockii Parodi. A specimen of this species has been found on waste ground in Chengdu, Sichuan."

Eleocharis acicularis often forms large rooted mats or floating masses, which when submerged, are often non-flowering.  Submerged, usually nonflowering plants are abundant throughout much of the range of the species (H. K. Svenson 1929; P. E. Rothrock and R. H. Wagner 1975).  They have been called E. acicularis forma fluitans (Doellinger) Svenson; E. acicularis forma inundata Svenson; E. acicularis forma longicaulis (Desmazières) Hegi; E. acicularis forma submersa (Nilsson) Norman; and E. acicularis var. submersa (Nilsson) Svenson.  The culms of the submerged plants are terete, smooth, soft to flaccid, translucent, and the partitions of the air cavities within are clearly visible.  Submerged plants may closely resemble aquatic forms of some other species, especially Eleocharis parvula, E. robbinsii, and Schoenoplectus subterminalis (Torrey) Sojak (N. C. Fassett 1957; E. G. Voss 1967, 1972–1996, vol. 3).


Most plants from the Arctic to cool-temperate North America, including higher elevations in the Southwest, are very similar to plants from northern Europe and presumably belong to typical E. acicularis, which was described from Europe.  Those plants have culms cylindric or three- to four-angled; leaf sheaths mostly obscure and closely sheathing; and achenes about two times longer than wide.


Eleocharis acicularis var. gracilescens Svenson, type from St. Louis, Missouri, applies to plants with flowering culms unusually long (to 60 cm), smooth or sometimes with five to twelve fine ridges, their bases not cormlike; spikelets often linear-lanceoloid, often unusually long (to 8 mm); floral scales often unusually long (to 3.5 mm), often stramineous; and achenes much less than two times longer than wide.  Plants of E. acicularis var. gracilescens are probably usually emergent in shallow water; they are known from scattered collections from Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.  Robust plants of E. acicularis var. gracilescens are sometimes misidentified as E. wolfii.  H. K. Svenson (1957) stated that var. gracilescens may be distinct from E. acicularis.  Some specimens from California and Oregon that resemble E. acicularis var. gracilescens may be ecologic forms of E. acicularis var. occidentalis.


Eleocharis acicularis var. occidentalis Svenson, type from Santa Barbara, California (illustrated in H. L. Mason 1957; H. K. Svenson 1939, plate 539), applies to plants with culms only 2–6 cm, smooth or usually some prominently four-angled or finely to ca. eight-ridged, their bases often persistent, swollen, and cormlike (illustrated herein); distal leaf sheath summits mostly evident, often markedly inflated; achenes much less than two times longer than wide.  This variety often grows in vernal pools.  As here defined, it is known only from Arizona, California, and Nevada.  Most of the specimens H. K. Svenson (1929) cited in the protologue and identified on herbarium specimens as E. acicularis var. occidentalis are probably referable to typical E. acicularis.

Flowering plants of Myriophyllum verticillatum are distinguished from other water-milfoils by reduced, pectinate floral bracts. Many Myriophyllum species can be mistaken for M. verticillatum at early stages of flowering because the proximal floral bracts are transitional in form from submersed leaves and are typically pectinate. The bracteoles also are highly distinctive and are deeply divided into as many as seven narrow lobes. The schizocarps are unique among water-milfoils in the flora area because they have a relatively thick exocarp that typically impedes the splitting and separation of the schizocarp into mericarps at maturity. The most robust and diminutive plants of M. verticillatum can be found in Saskatchewan. No specimens identifiable as M. verticillatum have been seen from New Mexico though it has been reported from there (P. T. Adams 1998). It is likely to occur in New Mexico given that it is found in neighboring states except Oklahoma. The presence and morphology of turions of M. verticillatum can be very helpful in the identification of vegetative material. The clavate to obdeltoid shape and reddish brown color of the turions in this species distinguishes it from the cylindrical, typically dark green turions of M. farwellii and M. sibiricum. 


Four varieties of Myriophyllum verticillatum have been proposed. Fassett based M. verticillatum var. cheneyi solely on the presence of four stamens. M. L. Fernald (1950) considered var. cheneyi conspe­cific with M. hippuroides. Some specimens labeled as var. cheneyi examined during this treatment were confirmed to represent M. hippuroides as noted by S. G. Aiken (1981). Fernald recognized vars. intermedium, pectinatum Wallroth, and pinnatifidum Wallroth based on differences in the length of floral bracts. All of these varieties can be found in the flora area though floral bract length is a very plastic character and there is no distinct separation among the forms. The presence and morphology of turions of M. verticillatum can be very helpful in the identification of vegetative material. The clavate to obdeltoid shape and reddish brown color of the turions in this species differ from the cylindrical, typically dark green turions of both M. farwellii and M. sibiricum."

Arundo donax,"

Perennial, with creeping woody rhizomes. Culms erect, up to 5 m high. Leaf-blades conspicuously distichous, linear-lanceolate, rounded or cordate at the base, 30-60 cm long, 2.5-5 cm wide, glabrous, smooth, long-attenuate at the tip. Panicle 30.60 cm long and 5.8(10) cm wide.

Considerable difficulty may be experienced in distinguishing immature plants of Arundo, Neyraudia and Phragmites, and dissecting the spikelets will be of little use. Phragmites can be distinguished by the silky beard at the bases of the lowest panicle branches which is absent from the other two genera. The ligule of Arundo is membranous while that of Phragmites and Neyraudia is a fringe of hairs. The leaves of Arundo are very much broader than in the other genera and are conspicuously cordate or rounded at the base."

Epilobium parviflorum most closely resembles E. hirsutum, sharing the otherwise unique combination of densely villous pubescence and 4-lobed stigmas, but differs by having smaller flowers, leaves not clasping and/or decurrent on stems, and perennating by rosettes rather than by thick ropy stolons. The two species co-occur throughout most of their range in Eurasia, and although their adventive ranges in North America are quite similar, E. hirsutum has spread much more widely and rapidly."

An aquatic grass with sweet stems and succulent foliage eagerly sought by cattle. Smaller plants with panicles about 6 cm long and purple spikelets have been separated as Catahrosa sikkimensis, but such variants occur sporadically throughout the range of Catahrosa aquatica and are of little taxonomic consequence. Another variant, even less well-marked, has shorter panicle branches (up to 5 cm) and smaller lemmas (1.5-1.7 mm long). It is sometimes separated as var. angusta."

The character of leaves spirally arranged seems not to be true for Hippuris spiralis. In fact, in that entity the leaves are whorled but the whorls are oblique. This variation may be caused by twisted shoots, especially in running water. Terminal subshoots are a common variant in H. vulgaris. For these reasons, both H. spiralis and H. vulgaris var. ramificans are treated here as synonyms of H. vulgaris."

Perennial with rhizomes and stolons. Culms 20–50 cm tall, nodes usually pubescent. Leaf sheaths keeled, glabrous, margins ciliate; leaf blades linear, 5–10 × 0.3–0.7 cm, glabrous, apex acute; ligule 2–3 mm. Inflorescence of 2(–3) racemes arising together or separated by a short axis; racemes 3–7 cm; spikelets single, in 2 rows; rachis straplike, 1.5–2 mm wide.

Schoenoplectus validus, described from the Caribbean, and S. tabernaemontani, described from Europe, are here treated as one variable, cosmopolitan species without infraspecific taxa, pending further studies (J. Browning et al. 1995b; S. G. Smith 1995).  Most North American plants have spikelets with reddish papillae or prickles on the scales, whereas some plants of coastal and boreal North America closely resemble most plants of northwestern Europe and southern Africa in their densely reddish prickly-papillose scales and are similar to the type of Scirpus glaucus J. E. Smith.

An allozyme study by L. L. Consaul et al. (1991) provided evidence of the allotetraploid origin of Persicaria maculosa, with P. lapathifolium as one of the parents. Plants with stems spreading-hairy and peduncles stipitate-glandular have been named P. maculosa subsp. hirsuticaulis (Danser) S. Ekman & Knutsson. Material referable to this subspecies has not been seen among North American specimens. Hybrids between P. maculosa and P. minor have been documented in Europe (R. H. Roberts 1977).


The Cherokee, Chippewa, and Iroquois prepared simple or compound decoctions of Persicaria maculosa, which they used as dermatological, urinary, gastrointestinal, and veterinary aids, for heart medicine, and as an analgesic (D. E. Moerman 1998)."

The Eurasian weeping birch ( Betula pendula ) is extensively cultivated throughout the temperate range of the flora, and it has been known to persist or to become locally naturalized in several areas, particularly in the Northeast. In vegetative features it resembles B . populifolia Marshall, to which it is closely allied; it can easily be distinguished from the latter by its peeling bark, as well as by its mostly pubescent leaves with somewhat shorter, acuminate apices."

Although broadly distributed in the northwest part of the flora, Nymphaea tetragona is apparently not common over the Canadian portion of its range. It was collected once in extreme northwestern Washington but is believed to be extirpated there. True N . tetragona is absent from northeastern North America and, now, from the conterminous United States, where this name has usually been applied to what is here segregated as N . leibergii . In size and shape of leaves and flowers the two taxa are very similar. They differ in the leaf mottling often present in developing leaves of N . tetragona but absent in N . leibergii ; the distinctly tetragonal appearance of the receptacle in N . tetragona ; and in the longer carpellary appendages, the presence usually of more stamens, and purple-colored stamens and pistils in N . tetragona . Only in living plants is it apparent that leaves of N . leibergii are thicker with impressed veins abaxially compared to the relatively thin leaves with raised veins in N . tetragona . Although distinctions in sepal and petal apices (often acute in N . tetragona and often rounded in N . leibergii ) were the basis for the establishment of Castalia leibergii , the characters are variable in both taxa and thus of limited utility in distinguishing them."

Less robust plants of Sparganium emersum are found from Manitoba, Minnesota, and Iowa, east to the Atlantic coast. They have erect leaves, 3--7 mm wide, much exceeding the short inflorescence; supra-axillary, sessile, and crowded pistillate heads; and 3--4 mm fruits with a 3--4 mm beak. Such plants have been called S. emersum subsp. acaule (C. D. K. Cook and M. S. Nicholls 1986), and they are widely known as S. chlorocarpum Rydberg var. acaule or S. chlorocarpum f.orma acaule. Inasmuch as they often grow with and are not always clearly distinct from typical plants, and in the absence of definitive, range-wide studies, they are recognized here only as a form (fide E. G. Voss 1966; G. E. Crow and C. B. Hellquist 1981).


Sparganium emersum is easily confused with S. angustifolium, especially when floating leaves are present, but it is distinguished by its leaves which are triangulate at least at the base, by its often more numerous staminate heads, at least some of which are not contiguous, and by its greenish fruits with longer beaks (C. D. K. Cook and M. S. Nicholls 1986). In northern and northwestern states and British Columbia, it resembles S. angustifolium in the distribution of the staminate heads, the distal of which tend to be confluent. Some Cook and Nicholls noted that sSome characters of S. angustifolium might have been incorporated into S. emersum, and our plants could be a stable hybrid that differs somewhat from S. emersum as it is known in Europe (C. D. K. Cook and M. S. Nicholls 1986). G. E. Larson (1993) called for further study of the entire S. emersum-S. angustifolium complex, which is perhaps better treated as one variable species, S. angustifolium (T. C. Brayshaw 1985)
Hybrids with Sparganium hyperboreum and S. natans have been reported from Europe but are doubted by C. D. K. Cook and M. S. Nicholls (1986). In eastern provinces and states, S. emersum could be confused with S. americanum and S. androcladum, but it can be distinguished from them by its supra-axillary pistillate heads and its tepals lacking a subapical dark spot."

The species is closely associated with rice cultivation. There are unbranched plants with flowers sessile at nodes of the main stem that do not form lateral spikelike inflorescences. Cook (1979) found that although the unbranched form was sometimes genetically fixed, in many geographically scattered populations it was not fixed but ecologically induced as a result of crowded growing conditions."

This widespread species occurs nearly throughout the tropical and warm-temperate regions of the Old World. Numerous varieties have been recognized in China, which may be identical with subspecies and varieties named in Africa (e.g., R. W. Haines & Lye, Sedges & Rushes E. Afr. 204-206. 1983) and S Asia (Karthikeyan, Fl. Ind. Enumerat. Monocot. 64. 1989). Such varieties were based on differences in ray and bract length, number of spikes per ray, and number of fertile glumes per spikelet. Intergradations have been noted by Haines and Lye (q.v.) and characterize some specimens from S China and SE Asia. D. A. Simpson and T. Koyama (Fl. Thailand 6(4): 382. 1998) noted variability in this species (as well as the following species) and recognized no infraspecific taxa. We follow their broad concept for this species and for C. cyperinus."

Plants treated as Eleocharis uniglumis fall within the large morphologic variation of Eurasian E. uniglumis.  Two subspecies and 3 varieties were recognized for northern Europe (S.-O. Strandhede 1966), and five species that were recognized by I. D. Zinserling (1935) were placed in synonymy under E. uniglumis (S.-O. Strandhede 1966).  Recognition of infraspecific taxa within North American E. uniglumis is premature.  Plants commonly called E. halophila or E. uniglumis var. halophila, found mostly in Atlantic Coastal brackish habitats, have floral scales that are usually narrower and more densely placed on the rachilla than plants usually called E. uniglumis, which are found mostly in the interior; some plants are intermediate in expression of these characters. The achene and tubercle shape characters used by M. L. Fernald (1950) to distinguish E. uniglumis from E. halophila are not valid.  In North America, E. uniglumis is difficult to separate from E. erythropoda and E. kamtschatica, in both of which the spikelets have only the proximal scale without a flower (empty) and the proximal scale completely amplexicaulous. Eleocharis uniglumis differs from E. erythropoda only in its broader floral scales, which are less densely placed on the rachilla; it differs from E. kamtschatica only in its smaller tubercles.  It is also difficult to separate from some specimens of E. macrostachya in which the spikelets have proximal scales that are sometimes completely amplexicaulous; such plants differ from E. uniglumis only in the absence of a flower in the axil of the subproximal scale of some of the spikelets.  I have not seen voucher specimens for the chromosome numbers of 2n = 27 and 28 reported by S.-O. Strandhede (1967) from Massachusetts and Nebraska, which are lower than the 2n = (44–)46(47–88) reported for Europe (S.-O. Strandhede 1965)."

Aquatic-adapted plants, which bloom in water or are sometimes stranded on land, have been called var. stipulacea (although that epithet may not be the oldest one available for the taxon). They produce ovoid-conic to short-cylindric inflorescences 10-40(-60) mm, prostrate aerial stems, and leaf blades that are glabrous with acute to rounded apices. Terrestrial forms of this ecotype usually are spreading-pubescent and often bear ocreae that are foliaceous, green, and flared distally, characters found only in North American plants (R. S. Mitchell 1968).
Terrestrial-adapted plants, referred to var. emersa, bloom on moist soil and produce short- to elongate-cylindric inflorescences 40-110(-150) mm, spreading or erect aerial stems, and leaf blades that are appressed-pubescent with acute to acuminate apices. They produce ocreae that are entirely chartaceous and not flared distally. Emergent and terrestrial plants of this ecotype exhibit less phenotypic plasticity and a lower frequency of heterostyly than do plants of the aquatic ecotype (R. S. Mitchell 1968)."

Potamogeton natans is the common floating-leaved pondweed of the north temperate ure areas. It is essentially circumboreal and can easily be identified by floating leaves that are almost always cordate at the base of the blade, the petiole with a short band of light tissue at its apex, and the submersed phyllodial leaves. Also, the apex of the petiole usually is bent so that the blade appears oriented in the opposite direction from which the petiole appears to be oriented.

Salix cinerea and S. atrocinerea are very closely related. Their occurrence in the flora area, as naturalized introductions, is not well understood, probably because they usually are introduced under the name S. caprea, and that species often is not treated in North American floristic literature (e.g., C. K. Schneider 1921; M. L. Fernald 1950). They probably are introductions of long-standing brought to the New World for their value as ornamentals and bee-plants. Salix atrocinerea was first documented in the southeastern United States (G. W. Argus 1986) after plants with ferruginous hairs and prominently striate wood were found in North Carolina; since that time, it has been found in other states and provinces. In the northeastern states, S. atrocinerea and S. cinerea are thought to be invasive species. The species do reproduce by seed and hundreds of seedlings were observed in a drained reservoir (A. Zinovjev, pers. comm.) and on sandy pond shores (T. Rawinski, pers. comm.), where they are thought to compete with native species.
The presence of long, prominent, striae on the peeled wood of 4-5 year old branches is commonly used in European literature (K. H. Rechinger 1993; A. K. Skvortsov 1999) to separate Salix cinerea and S. atrocinerea from S. caprea etc., in which the wood is smooth or with fewer, shorter striae. In the flora area, long striae also occur in S. bebbiana, S. discolor, and S. humilis, but usually they are not as long as or as prominent in S. cinerea and S. atrocinerea. Some floras (e.g., F. Martini and P. Paiero 1988) use the relative prominence of striae to separate S. cinerea and S. atrocinerea, but their separation remains difficult. The presence of ferruginous hairs on the leaves of S. atrocinerea is the best diagnostic characteristic, but they are not always present or easily observed. For a comparison of these species, see the key to species under subg. Vetrix. For further discussion of morphologies, see Salix ×smithiana Willdenow [p. 132] and 76. S. discolor."

Some of the extremely hispid forms [e.g. Chumba, Clarke 23756A (K); Hawalbagh, May 1845, Thomson (K)] have been labelled Lespedeza sesricea f. hispida by Schindler. There is considerable variation in the indumentum, ranging from plants with very few hairs on stem and leaf [e.g. Srinagar water works, 5500 ft., 25.8.1917, R.R.Stewart 3366 (K)] to extremely hispid forms [Chamba, Raipur, 4000 ft.,14.10.1874, C.B.Clarke 23756A (K); Him.bor. occ.,3-6000 ft.,12.5.48, T. Thomson (K); Hawalbagh, May 1845, T. Thomson (K)]. However, the variation is quite gradual, and does not seem to have any correlation with the geographical 
distribution either; hence no importance has been given to this character."

Carex divisa, although distinct species, is much variable, e.g. in length of bracts, venation of utricles etc. Boott (Trans. Linn. Soc. London 20: 133. 1851) separated from C. divisa eastern C. coarcta (sphalm. C. coacta) based on Griffith 79 from Afghanistan. This he later, in Ill. Gen. Carex 4: 204 (1867) reduced to varietal level under C. curaica. Kükenthal (in Engler, Pflanzenr. IV.20. 1909) misunderstood C. vulpinaris (see above) and  included into it, besides C. pycnostachya,  certain  robust,  eastern  specimens  of  C.  divisa.  Kreczetovicz  (in Kom., Fl. URSS 3. 1935) named the populations of C. divisa in Iran and eastwards as C. coarcta Boott, basing the distinction on the more robust vegetative structure of  C.  coarcta:  plants  taller,  leaves  wider,  spikes  larger  and  glumes  shorter than utricles. C. austroafghanica Raymond is also based on eastern specimens from Afghanistan, with very weakly nerved utricles. It is quite likely that some of the eastern populations need formal recognition, but at this stage it seems advisable to be content with a broad collective treatment."

Most specimens from eastern North America and some from the West can be placed in Eleocharis quinqueflora subsp. fernaldii (Svenson) Hultén, which is characterized by its small size (culms to 15 cm × 0.5 mm) and small bulbs.  Specimens of E. quinqueflora from 2000–3600 m in California, which are atypical, especially in that the proximal scales of the spikelets do not subtend flowers, may deserve taxonomic recognition.  Those plants are also small, with culms only to 15 cm × 0.5 mm; hard caudices are often present at the culm-tuft bases; small, narrowly ovoid bulbs are sometimes present; and perianth bristles are absent or rudimentary.  Very few specimens of E. quinqueflora are intermediate with E. suksdorfiana."

Carex vesicaria as here treated broadly as a variable circumpolar species.  K. K. Mackenzie (1931–1935) recognized a small segregate, Carex raeana Boott, but specimens referred here are either depauperate C. vesicaria or hybrids.  T. V. Egorova (1999) recognized C. vesicaria as a Eurasian and North American species but also recognized a primarily North American C. monile, occuring locally in Asia as well.  The two species were differentiated by characteristics of perigynium length and width, pistillate spike size, and beak and beak teeth size and proportions.  The North American material is so variable in perigynium size and shape and inflorescence size that recognizing the two entities seems difficult.  Further study of variation in North American material and the relationships of North American and Eurasian material are needed.  Indeed, the complex is in need of detailed systematic study on a worldwide scale."

Within North America several variants have sometimes been recognized and even treated as distinct species. Variety californica (Parnassia californica) has the cauline leaf in the distal half of the stem, and most populations in California and southern Oregon display this feature, but such plants rarely occur elsewhere in North America and some populations in eastern California have the cauline leaf in the proximal half of the stem. Populations in the Rocky Mountains and some adjacent ranges are sometimes recognized as P. montanensis, which has petals 7–9 × 5–7 mm and staminodes with seven to ten filaments. These are somewhat intermediate between P. palustris and P. parviflora, and it has been suggested that they may be of hybrid origin, although a similar variant occurs in northern Asia in the absence of P. parviflora. It is unclear whether all Parnassia from Arizona are P. parviflora or whether some are this small-flowered variant of P. palustris."

Salix ×fragilis Linnaeus: The hybrid white willow, S. alba Linnaeus × S. euxina I. Belyaeva, a European introduction, is the most commonly cultivated and naturalized tree-willow in the flora area. It is characterized by: trees, 3-20 m, stems erect or drooping; branches highly brittle at base; petioles with spherical or foliaceous glands distally, pilose or villous adaxially; largest medial leaf blade amphistomatous, very narrowly elliptic or narrowly elliptic, margins uniformly serrate or serrulate, abaxial surface glaucous, both surfaces sparsely long-silky to glabrescent, adaxial surface slightly glossy or dull; juvenile leaves at first densely long-silky soon glabrous; pistillate bract deciduous after flowering; stamens 2; anthers yellow; pistillate adaxial nectary shorter than or equal to stipe; stipe 0.3-0.5 mm; ovary pyriform, glabrous; ovules 6-12 per ovary; styles 0.4-1 mm; capsules 4.5-6 mm; 2n = 57, 76. Flowering is in late May-early June. Individual trees can persist for years by trunk suckering and spread vegetatively by shoot fragmentation along stream margins, shingle and sand beaches, sedge meadows, hardwood forests, and sand pits. It occurs from 0 to 2500 m in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan; Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
A study of Salix ×fragilis in Colorado (as S. ×rubens) showed that 2172 of 2175 trees were pistillate. Occasionally seed was set, possibly fertilized by S. alba (P. B. Shafroth et al. 1994). There are at least five clones of S. ×fragilis (as S. ×rubens) in cultivation (T. Berg in B. Jonsell and T. Karlsson 2000+, vol. 1); the pistillate are sterile but the staminate produce viable pollen. The hybrid plants are often misidentified as S. ""fragilis"" or as S. nigra. In the flora area, reproduction of the hybrid seems to be mainly by stem fragmentation.
Salix ×fragilis can be separated from S. euxina by having branches and branchlets hairy or glabrescent in age versus glabrous; leaf blades not glaucous abaxially versus glaucous; leaves amphistomatous versus hypostomatous or with stomata only along veins and at apex; and pistillate catkins slender and loosely flowered versus stout and moderately densely flowered.
Salix ×jesupii Fernald: S. alba × S. lucida; S. ×ehrhartiana of authors, not G. Meyer. The origin of this hybrid, between a European and a native species, is unknown. It is characterized by: shrubs or trees, 7-10 m; branchlets red-brown; petioles convex to shallowly grooved adaxially, 3-11 mm, with pairs or clusters of spherical or stalked glands distally; largest medial leaf blade amphistomatous or hemiamphistomatous, abaxial surface glaucous, sparsely long-silky to glabrescent, hairs white and ferruginous; floral bract apex acute to rounded, toothed or entire; pistillate flowering branchlet 8-16 mm, bract deciduous after flowering; stamens 3-5; stipes 0.3-0.6 mm; ovary pyriform, glabrous; ovules 12-14 per ovary; styles 0.3-0.8 mm; capsules 4-5 mm. Flowering is late April-mid May. It occurs in the flora area on the edges of streams and lakes, in wet deciduous woods, sand dunes, and wet railroad rights-of-way, at 10-300 m, in Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan; Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. It is possibly introduced in Washington."

Psidium guineense Swartz, common in tropical and subtropical America, is a similar weedy species that is often confused with P. guajava. One specimen collected at Bradenton, Florida, in 1916 has been seen; it may be expected in the southeastern United States. Psidium guineense differs from P. guajava in having leaves with fewer lateral veins, usually erect, reddish brown (not appressed and whitish) hairs on the abaxial surfaces, anthers 1–3 mm, and a calyx that tears in usually five (not three) segments."

Hydrilla verticillata,"

Rhizomes and erect stems with turions; subterranean turions cream-brown, appearing as tubers, surface smooth; turions from erect stems olive-green, covered with short, stiff scales. Leaves 8--15(--20) ´ 1.2--4 mm, margins serrulate. Inflorescences: spathe of 2 connate bracts. Flowers 1 per spathe; staminate pedicels 0.5 mm; pistillate flowers with floral tube 10--50 mm; ovary 1-locular. 2n = 32.

Hydrilla verticillata is widely distributed in the Eastern Hemisphere but it is uncertain as to where it is truly native. It grows in a variety of aquatic habitats ranging from acidic to basic, oligotrophic to eutrophic, fresh to brackish, and from a few centimeters to a meter or more if light penetrates that deeply. Growth and spread often are rapid. Stem fragments become rooted by fine, unbranched adventitious roots and soon produce vegetative reproductive structures from both subterranean and erect stems. Tubers produced on subterranean stems are pale brown; those produced on erect stems are dark olive-green and covered with short, stiff scales. Both types germinate quickly to produce new stems."

Agrostis clavata,"

Annual or short-lived perennial, loosely tufted. Culms erect or geniculate at base, slender, 30–70 cm tall, 2–4-noded. Leaf sheaths smooth; leaf blades linear, flat, thin, 6–15 cm × 1–5 mm, both surfaces scabrid; ligule 1.5–3 mm, back scabrid, apex obtuse or lacerate. Panicle lax, lanceolate to narrowly oblong in outline, 8–25 cm; branches 2–7 at each node, ascending, capillary, 8–15 cm, scabrid, bare in lower 1/3–1/2 or sometimes with spikelets from base. Spikelets 1.5–2.5 mm, yellowish green; glumes lanceolate, subequal, lower slightly longer, keeled, keels aculeate-scabrid, apex acuminate; callus glabrous or nearly so; lemma 2/3–3/4 spikelet length, awnless, apex obtuse; palea to 0.25 mm. Anthers 0.3–0.5 mm. Fl. and fr. summer and autumn.


Agrostis clavata is distinguished by the combination of scabrid leaves and panicle branches, small, pale green spikelets, acuminate glumes, an awnless lemma, and very small palea and anthers.
Agrostis clavata subsp. matsumurae (A. clavata var. nukabo) is often recognized, mainly on the basis of a dense, narrow panicle bearing spikelets from the base of the primary branches. In contrast, subsp. clavata has panicle branches divergent at flowering and bare in the lower 1/3–1/2. However, short, densely spiculate branches are often present at the panicle nodes among the longer, bare-based branches in subsp. clavata, contributing to a denser panicle appearance when frequent. All the panicle branches become erect in the fruiting stage, further blurring the boundary with subsp. matsumurae. It has not been possible to distinguish two subspecies satisfactorily in herbarium material."
Carex aperta,"

Plants not cespitose.  Culms acutely angled, 15–90 cm, scabrous.  Leaves: basal sheaths red-brown; sheaths of proximal leaves with blades, backs glabrous, fronts with pale brown spots, veinless, glabrous, apex U-shaped, membranous, colorless; blades 3–6 mm wide.  Inflorescences: proximal bract subequal to inflorescence, 2–4 mm wide.  Spikes: erect; proximal 2–3 spikes pistillate, 1.5–3.5 cm × 4–6 mm, base obtuse; terminal 1–2 spikes staminate.  Pistillate scales red-brown, longer than perigynia, apex acute or acuminate, awnless.  Perigynia divergent, olive-brown with red-brown spots on apical 1/2, veinless, inflated, loosely enclosing achenes, obovoid, 2.5–2.8 × 1.5–2 mm, dull, apex rounded, papillose; beak green, 0.1–0.3 mm.  Achenes not constricted, dull.  2n = 54.


Carex aperta and C. haydenii appear to be a very closely related, allopatric pair of species that may not be closely related to other members of the section. This species-pair is distinguished by the inflated perigynia, the acute scales that are longer than the perigynia, and the unique chromosome number.  Carex aperta is distinguished from C. haydenii by its rhizomatous habit, the dull brown achenes, and the entire beak.  It is sometimes mistaken for the sympatric taxa that also lack veins on the perigynia, C. aquatilis and C. scopulorum; mature specimens can easily be identified by the inflated perigynia."
Carex aperta,"

Rhizome short, stoloniferous. Culms tufted, 60-70 cm tall, trigonous, rigid, smooth, scabrous above, clothed at base with reddish bladeless sheaths.

Nutlets loosely enveloped; style base not thickened; stigmas 2."
Carex gynocrates,"

Rhizomes horizontal, threadlike, 0.3–0.8 mm in diam.  Culms arising singly or 2–3 together, ± terete, scarcely furrowed, 2–30 cm; lateral sterile shoots often with prostrate or curved base.  Leaf blades filiform, 2–15 cm × 0.3–0.7 mm.  Inflorescence androgynous (14%), wholly staminate (12%), or wholly pistillate (74%); staminate spike 8–16 mm; pistillate spike ± densely 4–15(–18)-flowered, transversely broadly oblong to ovoid-oblong or oblong, 5–14 × 4–8 mm.  Pistillate scales uniformly light to dark brown or with pale or green midvein, margins scarious, narrow to broad.  Perigynia becoming divergent or slightly deflexed, yellow, olive, or at maturity chestnut-brown, obscurely to evidently 17–20-striate (marginal ribs seldom prominent), oblong-ovoid, biconvex, 2.9–3.4 × 1.2–1.7 mm; beak 0.5 mm, margins glabrous or sparsely scabrid.  Achenes 1.5–1.7 × 1–1.2 mm.  2n = 46, 48.

Opinions differ about the taxonomic rank of the North American and east Asian (Siberian) populations, which have chromosome counts of 2n = 48, 50, and 70, and perhaps are best segregated as Carex dioica subsp. gynocrates (E. Hultén 1962).  The latter is only weakly distinguished from the Eurasian subsp. dioica, which has chromosome counts of 2n = 52 and 60, and tends to be less strongly dioecious, and has paler pistillate scales and ventrally more convex perigynia. 


The hybrid between Carex gynocrates and C. maritima, C. ×langeana  Fernald (pro sp.) [C. dutillyi  O’Neill & Duman], strongly resembles C. maritima; the leaves are slightly scabrous-roughened toward the apex; the heads are smaller, ellipsoid to ovoid-oblong and only 3–5 mm thick; the perigynia are appressed-ascending and ± flat; and the achenes are not well-developed.  Carex ×langeana is reported as forming close turf on dry, peaty limestone barrens in Newfoundland (M. L. Fernald 1933, 1950) and as occasional upon humid rocks and coastal fens along Hudson Bay (J. Deshaye and J. Cayouette 1988).  The hybrid should be expected where the parents coexist and has been reported from most of those areas (J. Cayouette and P. M. Catling 1992), although the report of the hybrid from Alaska by H. J. Scoggan (1978–1979) is based on a specimen of C. maritima."

Achenes light to dark brown, 1.5 –1.9 × 1–1.2 mm.


Carex laxa superficially resembles C. limosa in size and habit; it is easily distinguished by its sheathing proximal inflorescence bracts, by its rhizomatous habit, and by its roots lacking a dense covering of root hairs. Carex limosa has sheathless inflorescence bracts, is stoloniferous, and has roots densely covered with yellowish orange root hairs. Carex laxa may well be overlooked in the north, being mistaken in the field for the more common C. limosa."

Plants of Myriophyllum ussuriense typically grow in a semi-terrestrial habit in shallow water or on saturated sediments to a height of 20 cm. Shoots often have swollen stem bases that taper dramatically towards the apex. In some populations, extensive production of erect shoots from rhizomes produce dense stands. The floral bracts are distinctive, being opposite or alternate and elongate with usually 2–8 relatively short segments. Dimorphism in size between staminate and pistillate flowers of M. ussuriense is distinctive. Although most populations appear to be unisexual with staminate plants predominating and pistillate plants rare (O. Ceska et al. 1986), the latter are extremely small with a vestigial perianth and are easily overlooked, indicating that monoecy may be more common than thought in this species. S. Ueno and Y. Kadono (2001) reported that seven of 80 populations of M. ussuriense in Japan had some monoecious plants. No fruit was found despite an extensive examination of available material.
Submersed plants have pectinate leaves that are extremely delicate with usually fewer than 12 straight segments. A useful characteristic of some leaves is that the central axis terminates in a right-angled bifurcation."

Myriophyllum alterniflorum is distinguished in flower and fruit by minute, alternate, entire distal floral bracts, a characteristic shared only with M. laxum. Unlike the flowers of other Myriophyllum species in the flora, those of M. alterniflorum are widely scattered along the inflorescence and the tip of the spike is often nutant. The pistils are relatively small, each having a prominent, purple, pulvinate stigma that is as broad as or broader than the ovary and persistent in fruit. The pistil and mericarp surface has scattered orange to red punctate trichomes not seen on the pistils or mericarps of any other water-milfoil in the flora area. The cream, depressed-ovate, fringed, often aristate bracteoles with brown to red margins are also distinctive. Seed-set appears to be rare in M. alterniflorum. Specimens examined from Greenland far exceed other North American plants in the size of their leaves and staminate flowers. North American plants with relatively short leaves and a bushy habit have been referred to as var. americanum. Plants of this form can be confused with the relatively small M. sibiricum and M. verticillatum in northern latitudes but are distinguishable based on floral characters. Leaf size in M. alterniflorum is plastic and continuous in variation, thus varieties are not recog­nized here as separate taxa."

Primula egaliksensis,"

Plants 4-12.5 cm, herbaceous; rhizomes thin, short; rosettes not clumped; vegetative parts efarinose. Leaves not aromatic, abruptly petiolate; petiole not winged; blade without deep reticulate veins abaxially, elliptic, 1.5-5.5 × 0.5-0.9 cm, thin, margins entire, undulate, or slightly denticulate, apex rounded, surfaces glabrous. Inflorescences 1-3(-6)-flowered; involucral bracts gibbous but not auriculate, ± equal. Pedicels nodding, thin, 2-9 mm, length 1-3 times bracts, flexuous. Flowers homostylous; calyx green or with purple stripes, cylindric, 4-6 mm; corolla white or lavender, tube 6-8 mm, length 1-1.2 times calyx, eglandular, limb 6-8 mm diam., lobes 3-4 mm, apex slightly emarginate.

Morphologic and genetic evidence (A. Guggisberg et al. 2006) indicates that Primula egaliksensis is a hybrid between sects. Aleuritia and Armerina, with probable parents being P. nutans and P. mistassinica or an ancestral form of that species. The rounded, petiolate leaves and narrow capsules ally it strongly to sect. Armerina, and it has traditionally been placed in that section. Primula egaliksensis has frequently been confused with P. nutans; it differs in its smaller, homostylous flowers and the absence of auriculate bracts."

Cyperus rotundus is documented in Connecticut, Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania; there is no evidence of persistent populations.


Cyperus esculentus and C. rotundus are the only two species of subg. Cyperus in the New World that produce tuberiferous stolons.  The two species also have persistent floral scales and persistent rachillas, a combination of characteristics not found in any other New World species of Cyperus.


Cyperus rotundus is distinguished from other species of the genus in the New World by its open spikes composed of linear reddish spikelets borne on a conspicuous slender rachis.  Cyperus rotundus is usually acknowledged to be the world’s worst weed (cf. G. C. Tucker 1987).  In the United States, it does not grow north of the mean 1°C January isotherm.  Cyperus esculentus (preceding species) is a serious weed in much of the world, especially in cooler regions where the more tropical C. rotundus does not grow.  Cyperus esculentus is able to tolerate lower air temperatures (as low as -18°C).  The two species apparently differ also in their thermal optima for growth."

Based upon examination of specimens for this treatment, and as pointed out by A. E. Orchard (1981), most of the characters initially proposed by M. L. Fernald (1919c) and expanded upon by S. G. Aiken (1981) that are thought to be reliable for distinguishing the two species, such as size and shape of floral bracts and bracteoles, anther length, swollen base of inflorescence, color of the stem in dried material, extent of branching, and differences in mericarps, break down when a wide range of North American herbarium material is examined. One of the few useful vegetative characters to distinguish these species in the northern regions of North America is that M. sibiricum often produces turions in the latter part of the growing season, whereas M. spicatum does not (E. Hultén 1947). The most commonly used vegetative character to distinguish the two species is the number of leaf segments in submersed leaves (Fernald). When attempting to distinguish plants of the latter two species, this is a reliable character, but only when specimens have low (6–18) or high (24–42) segment numbers; plants often have submersed leaves with intermediate segment numbers."

Trapa natans was first noted in Massachusetts in 1859 from an unknown origin and was recorded from the Charles River, Cambridge, in 1879. The hard, spiny fruits can cause severe puncture wounds and are slow to decay in lake and river bottoms. The species propagates by seed and by detached floating rosettes to form extensive floating mats that reduce oxygen, restrict light, crowd out native plants, and make navigation difficult. Populations grow rapidly and are difficult to eradicate except by sustained efforts over multiple seasons. Federal regulations now prohibit interstate sale and transport of T. natans. The species is considered rare and threatened in Europe."

Within the enormous variation displayed by Epilobium ciliatum, three broadly defined entities can be recognized: subsp. Watsonii, characteristically with bracts scarcely reduced on an extended, crowded corymbose inflorescence, found only along the Pacific coast, usually within sight of the ocean; subsp. Glandulosum, generally large, few-branched plants with condensed turions just below ground and crowded inflorescences of relatively large rose-purple flowers, found mainly in damp, cool, and relatively undisturbed habitats; and subsp. Ciliatum, which range from small and simple to large and well-branched, usually with leafy basal rosettes and open inflorescences, relatively narrow leaves and small white flowers, found most often in disturbed damp to dry habitats throughout the entire range of the species. These subspecies often intergrade in regions where their ranges overlap, resulting in populations with diverse mixtures of intermediate characters, yet the subspecies consistently retain their main morphological characteristics in populations throughout most of their respective ranges. Each shows some degree of endogenous variability, most notably in the very widespread subsp. Ciliatum."

Male inflorescence to 60 cm, pedunculate, paniculately compound with ultimate spiciform branches; spathes 13-18, white, narrowly lanceolate, 10-60 × 1.5-4 cm, serrate on margin and midvein; spikes pendulous, 8-20 mm; stamens 10(-25), racemosely fasciculate; filaments connate below, 1-3 mm; anthers linear, ca. 3 × 0.6 mm, connective mucronate. Female inflorescence capitate, solitary, globose to ovoid-ellipsoid, 10-25 cm; spathes numerous, white, 15-30 × 1.4-2.5 cm, margin serrate; ovule 1 per locule.

Fl. Jan-May, fr. Oct.
According to FRPS (8: 20. 1992), Pandanus tectorius var. sinensis (a variety not accepted in this treatment on the authority of Stone, Fl. Cambodge, Laos & Vietnam 20: 24. 1983) occurs on seaside beaches in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Taiwan and differs from the typical variety in having leaves narrower, attenuate into a long flagelliform apex, to 15 cm; ovary (4 or)5- or 6(or 7)-locular; and syncarp smaller, globose, ca. 8 × 8 cm, consisting of 50-60 phalanges, each phalange ca. 2.5 × 2 cm. Stone (loc. cit.) considered P. tectorius var. sinensis, with phalanges ca. 3.5 × 4 cm, to be a synonym of P. odoratissimus, with phalanges 3-8 × 2.5-4.5 cm. The correct name of this taxon has long been controversial (see Martelli, ""Pandanus odoratissimus"" o ""Pandanus tectorius""? Nuovo Giorn. Bot. Ital., n.s. 36: 329-337. 1929). Stone (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 97: 36-38. 1988) reinstated P. tectorius, reversing his former acceptance of P. odoratissimus (Fl. Cambodge, Laos & Vietnam 20: 23. 1983). The type specimen of P. remotus, a name synonymized by Stone (loc. cit.: 24), is from Hong Kong (Shek O)."

Type: Japan, herb. Thunberg (UPS). 
1. Palea-keels: smooth palea-keels are confined to South and tropical Africa (Eragrostis namaquensis Schrad.)- scaberulous keels are found throughout tropical Africa (Eragrostis diplachnoides) and Asia.
2. Spikelet size: plants with few-flowered spikelets and lemmas less than 1 mm are generally separated as Eragrostis japonica sensu stricto, although similar forms from Africa with smooth palea-keels are called Eragrostis namaquensis, and those with rough keels are called Eragrostis diplachnoides.
3. Panicle-form: three main sorts can be recognised; interrupted with branches in pseudo whorls (Eragrostis koenigii), almost exclusively Asian; partly whorled but more generally open, branches branched from the base (Eragrostis diarrhena, Eragrostis namaquensis and Eragrostis japonica); branches solitary, bare at the base, panicle open (Eragrostis diplachnoides).
Spikelet and lemma size and panicle form are continuously variable with complete intergradation between the extremes; the two sorts of variation work wholly independently of one another. Furthermore the two forms of palea-keel show no correlation with either of the other two variables. In view of this it is quite impracticable to subdivide the Asian species until some Comprehensive biosystematic study has been undertaken. In the meantime, therefore, all Asian species and varieties, however unsatisfactory this may seem, are reduced to synonymy."

Echinochloa crus-galli (Cockspur Grass, Cockspur Panic-grass, Barn-yard Grass, Barnyard Millet) is distinguished by its untidy racemes of acuminate or awned spikelets. It is a polymorphic weed of warm temperate and subtropical regions, whose numerous intergrading races are apparently the consequence of cleistogamous self-pollination. There is much uncertainty as to which segregates are worth recognising as species (see, for example, Gould, Fairbrothers and Ali in Amer. Midl.

As circumscribed here, Cyperus odoratus is easily identified by its cylindric to subcylindric spikelets in which the corky rachilla of the mature spikelet disarticulates at the base of each scale.  The mature spikelet breaks into segments each consisting of a scale and an internode of the rachilla clasping the achene with its corky wings.  Cyperus odoratus is an exceedingly variable pantropical and warm-temperate species.  Numerous segregates have been named, some of which may deserve recognition when the species is studied in detail worldwide."
